Previously it was ignoring the request completely. Now it sees the request sends an empty certificate list in the same manner as OpenSSL.    - SSLSecurityParameters now has a var to determine if it should send a certificate back to the server. Previously it just used a fixed check against the cipherSuite. If this var is nil, it still uses the suite for the value.  It is now set to true if the server sends a certificate request in the handshake.    - SSLSecurityParameters now has a predicate #requiresClientCertificateVerify theat is used to see if the cert verify signature needs to be sent during the handshake.    - SSLSecurityCoordinator has the new setupClientCertificateMsg: to setup the certificate message.  Currently it does nothing as the cert msg is initialize to empty, which is what we want.    - SSLSecurityCoordinator has the signClientCertificateVerify: to setup the certificate verify message.  Currently it does nothing as we are not sending verifys.    - Modified SSLClientWaintingForServerHelloDone>>sendMessages to use the #requiresClientCertificateVerify predicate to determine if the cert verify should be sent.    - Modified SSLClientWaintingForServerHelloDone>>processCertificateRequestMessage:  to set the requiresClientCertificate state in the params to true.    - Added SSLClientSendCertificate>>send . Creates, sets up, and sends a cert message.    - Modified SSLClientSendCertificateVerify>>send to hand the certificate verify message to the security coordinator so it can be signed.- In the process of determining what the problems with the handshake were, a lot of reformatting of the code and modification of the error handling was done.     - New error class SSLConnectionClosedError to be thrown when the SSL machinery notices that the socket has been closed.    - Most of the error logging has been commented out, but a bit remains. Searching for the string ''{SSL-'' in the sources will find it. ' id '3d2e1ab8-5838-4cbd-aa1e-0ffc0a833c9b' date '11/17/2008' time '00:48:23' author 'jrd' ancestors ((name 'SSL-dgc.9' message 'Added more root certificates as copied from Firefox.Added ability to import all certificats found in a directory.
